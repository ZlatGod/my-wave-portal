Give song recommendations to your friend using the Blockchain. We use the Ethereum testnet to run a smart contract that was written in Solidity. It is supported by a ReactApp. We use fake ether(Rinkeby test net) to send messages to anyone in the world. 
You need to connect your crypto wallet and need to get some Rinkeby Ether through a faucet.

Or just message me on LinkedIn and I'll send you some Rinkeby Ether.
